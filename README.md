# Image-Captioning

The main idea behind this project is to use LSTM layers and do a process analogous to Markov Chain to generate words given a previous string and image context vector.
This project is based on my basic understanding of LSTM, computer vision and sentiment analysis and articles read on medium.com along with my machine learning course at Coding Blocks.

### Dependencies :
  1. Keras
  2. TensorFlow
  3. Numpy
  5. Matplotlib

## Dataset :

I have used Flickr8k dataset (available on Kaggle) in this project alongwith GloVe vectors by Stanford University.
Note : The dataset is not included in this repo. and the folder names in Image Captioning.ipynb may not match on your system.


## Results : 

Random image was chosen (as per the code) with appreciable results
